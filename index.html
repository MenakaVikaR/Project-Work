    <h2>Shefali Khanna x Sundari Silks</h2>
    <p>It was a delightful experience for us as a brand to be a part of The 5th Walking Hand-in-Hand event, a yearly fashion showcase conducted by the CDS Art Foundation, Ahmedabad. We collaborated with renowned fashion designer Shefali Khanna who features the timeless Kanchipuram weaves in a brand new avatar, by weaving together a melodious harmony of two contrasting worlds of classic and contemporary.</p>

    <p>“The challenge was to rethink Kanchipuram sarees and fabricate creations that would appeal to a global fashion-forward audience. The focus was on versatility, finesse and integrity without diluting its legacy. The showcase is to make people pause, rethink and adopt Indian handloom textiles.”</p>
